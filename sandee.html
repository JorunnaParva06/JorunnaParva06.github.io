    <p>
        Welcome to the 3D Stuff page! Here you can take a look at some of my 3D-related projects. I make 3D models and animations using Blender and I have
        created 3D prints as well.

<section class="Introduction">
    <h1 class="important-header">3D Modelling with Blender</h1>
    <p>
        The software I use to make my 3D projects is Blender which is a free and open-source software. I learned how to use Blender through tutorials on Youtube
        and messing around with Blender on my own time. 
    </p>
    <h1>Synsun City</h1>
    <img src="img/Synsun City.png" alt="A glowing neon city" width="800" height="450">
    <p>
        Here is a 3D render of mine which I created in school. For this one I played around with the lighting and the colours until it was right.
        This piece is inspired by the music style of Synthwave which is often complemented by cool visuals of neon cityscapes and beautiful lights. I tried
        replicating that style by using lots of blues and purples and including many glowing lights emanating from the buildings. I also threw in some cars to 
        liven up the place and the Synthwave sun in the background to watch over the cityscape.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make this render I began by creating a layout of where all the different buildings would be. I started by creating a long road, then began modelling 
        buildings with basic geometric shapes around it. The first one I made is based on Taipei 101 which you can see near the middle of the image. I then added
        blue and purple colourations to everything as well as glowing lights to the faces of the buildings to brighten up the landscape. I then created the Synthwave
        sun by adding a gradient to a sphere and creating slices through it using boolean modifiers. Finally I made the starry night sky and created the cars, 
        streetlamps, plants and benches that dot the sidewalks.
    </p>
    <h1>Buildings</h1>
    <img src="img/Building2.png" alt="Rectangular buildings" width="800" height="450">
    <p>
        This is my first ever finished Blender render and where my 3D modelling journey began. Shown above is a series of apartment buildings by a road surrounded by 
        rectangular trees and fallen bricks. Originally the trees were floating slightly above the ground, but I've fixed that now. I made this by following a Blender 
        tutorial and once the video was finished, this is what I ended up with. For this render I just used basic geometric shapes like cubes and cylinders as well as 
        simple and colourful materials.
    </p>
    <h1>Psychic Slug Boi</h1>
    <img src="img/Psychic_Speekabrank.png" alt="Slug Boi in space" width="800" height="450">
    <p>
        This here is a render of Slug Boi's head, the little guy who represents my online presence! I haven't thought of a better name, so I just call him Slug Boi.
        I originally made this render as a visual for a remix I made of the song "Psychic Island" from the videogame My Singing Monsters. If you are curious about that 
        video you can see it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYXsxUPxwKE" title="Click here to check out my Psychic Island remix">here</a>. 
    </p>    
    <p>
        I wanted this image to look spacey as the original song had a vast psychic spaciness to it. The outer space background of the render is actually the same as 
        the background in Synsun City, just with different colours. This is the first time I really experimented with lighting. I made the eyes glow to stand out in 
        the darkness of space and added some spotlights to create 3-point lighting. 3-point lighting is a method for lighting up objects that unsuprisingly uses 3 
        lights to create a sort of studio lighting effect. 
    </p>
    <h1>Backrooms Level 94</h1>
    <img src="img/Backrooms Level 94.png" alt="Houses on large grassy hills" width="800" height="450">
    <p>
        This is a render of something known as "The Backrooms Level 94". I created this render as an art project for my highschool art class since I had no other
        assignments to do and I wanted to hone my 3D modelling skills a bit more. For context, The Backrooms come from a 4chan creepypasta which depicted an
        uncanny liminal space. Shortly after the post was uploaded, others began adding to the idea, creating many different levels and entities which inhabit the 
        endless Backrooms. One of these levels is called Level 94, which is what this render is based on. Level 94 is a town that sits in a vast, grassy, hilly
        landscape with blue skies all around. During the day the town is safe, but once night falls the "Animations" come out to hunt. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For this render I used particle
        effects to create the grass that covers the landscape. Originally the grass was too huge and covered the landscape in a jungle as tall as the houses. It wasn't 
        until I got far into this project that I realized my viewport settings and render settings were not the same, which is why everything looked fine until I rendered it.
        I also used bump maps to create more immersive textures on the houses, paths and the water tower in the background. Bump maps essentially simulate bumps 
        and divots on the surfaces of objects which can create a much more realistic texture.
    </p>
    <h1>Rain World</h1>
    <img src="img/Floes4.png" alt="Large scary bird hunting a small creature" width="800" height="450">
    <p>
        Like the Psychic Slug Boi I made before, I made this render to go along with a remix I made of a song. This time the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzsquWZfzUM" title="Click here to check out my Floes remix">remix</a> was of "Floes" from the videogame
        Rain World. Pictured is a small white creature known as a slugcat, the main protagonist of the game which you control. The slugcat is hiding from a much
        larger and formidable creature known as a Miros Bird. The biomechanical bird, With its shining eye, stalks the Shaded Citadel in search of the hiding slugcat
        who cowers in fear from the razor sharp beak. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For this render I again experimented with lighting. The environment I created is extremely dark, so to compensate I made many elements of the render glow in the 
        dark. The yellow eye of the bird glows bright in the night and in the background blue plants illuminate the landscape. I wanted to make the bird look terrifying
        and menacing, so I filled its beak with a bunch of cones to create its teeth. Fun fact: the bird is covered in highly detailed feathers that severely heated up
        my computer to dangerous levels as I was creating the render, however you can only a few on the top of its head. I made the rest of its body too, but you don't 
        see that in the render either. So yes, I did a bunch of extra work only for it to go unused. Once all the shapes were done, I created some textures for the walls
        and ground as well as a yellow spotlight to add to the bird's threatening glare.
    </p>
    <h1>Airplane</h1>
    <img src="img/I'll Find a Way Through, I Always Do .png" alt="Airplane flying through a stormy sky" width="800" height="450">
    <p>
        This render is another project I made for my highschool art class. The title of my piece is called "I'll Find a Way Through, I Always Do" and captures
        my state of mind during my grade 12 year. In grade 12 I've had so many things pop up that have caused intense feelings of stress, such as university applications,
        school work and commitments to projects which all intersected with one another and created a busy schedule for me. I was the plane, soaring through a stormy sky
        with lighting that tries to strike me down, but I find a way through. No matter how much lighting and thunder the world throws at you, keep flying and 
        you'll find a clearer place on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here I created actual 3D clouds for the first time as well as lightning using the Blender grease pencil. I had a major struggle with the grease pencil as I
        tried to figure out its quirks and rules, and for a long while I didn't realize that the grease pencil would only show up in the final render until the render
        was completely done. Because of this misunderstanding I spent too much time watching videos about the grease pencil and finding no solution to my problem
        until I found it on some forum. Besides that minor mishap the rest of the render went quite well. I learned how to make clouds using volume modifiers as well as 
        rain using particles. I then added motion blur to the rain and jet engines by animating them which created more movement in the image and made the plane look more like 
        it was actually flying through the sky, rather than hovering on a string.
    </p>
    <h1>Shrek</h1>
    <img src="img/ShrekFoundYou.png" alt="Shrek staring at you ominously" width="800" height="450">
    <p>
        Here is a render of Shrek from the movie "Shrek" staring at you ominously in The Backrooms. The original purpose of this render was to be a game over screen
        in a cheap horror game my friend and I were working on using the Unity game engine. In the game, you are in The Backrooms and must escape the colossal labrynth by 
        finding the exit elevator. As you explore The Backrooms, various entities hunt you down, one of these entities being Shrek. As of now the game which we call 
        "Imposter Syndrome" is on indefinite hiatus, as Unity tried to charge developers for each download of their games, which we did not appreciate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The environment of The Backrooms utilizes a bump map for the carpet and the ceiling. I found some nice textures for carpet and ceiling tiles and applied them
        to some planes which created the somewhat realistic floor and ceiling you see in the render. The thing that's definitely not realistic about this render
        however is Shrek. Shrek is the first fictional character (besides my slug dude) that I tried to create in 3D. I found a reference image of him online, imported 
        it into my Blender project and began following the reference by creating basic shapes and molding them until they looked like Shrek. I animated him too which you
        can see in the animation section of my website, however Shrek's animations weren't the best as it was my first time using rigs for animation in Blender. His sleeve
        and arm did not move with eachother, so his arm clipped through his clothing as he walked and ran. I also made sure to give Shrek an unsettling smile filled with
        many teeth as he was part of a horror game, and when he chased you I wanted to make sure it felt extremely disturbing and horrifying.
    </p>
    <h1>Slug Toaster</h1>
    <img src="img/SlugToasterBlur.png" alt="Slug Boi turned into a toaster in space" width="800" height="450">
    <p>
        This render is one I made just for fun. Pictured is Slug Boi, but I turned him into a toaster and put him in a kitchen floating through space. For this one I 
        mainly wanted to improve my 3D modelling skills and see if I was capable of creating something as complex as a typical toaster. I'd say that I was succesful
        in creating the slug toaster, and like my Rain World render I yet again created details that the camera does not see. On the back of the slug toaster are 
        several buttons with different labels I created using text. You can't see them here, but trust me they're there. I also experimented with depth of field in this image.
        If you look at the slug toaster you'll notice that it looks more clear than its surroundings which are blurry. Additionally, the stars which are reflected in
        the glasses are blurry too. This blur is created by depth of field. I focused the camera n the toaster, meaning its surroundings became unclear and the focus 
        and main focal point of the image is the toaster.
    </p>
    <h1>Behind the Scenes</h1>
    <p>
        Below are some screenshots of the Blender projects I showcased here. You can see some of the behind the scenes of my renders.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Screenshot1.png" alt="Top down view of Synsun City">
    <p>
        The is a top down view of Synsun City. Here you can see the layout of the scene. The camera is near the right of the scene from this angle and is pointing
        towards the left.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Screenshot2.png" alt="The full body of the miros bird">
    <p>
        This is the full body of the Miros Bird. Here you can see all the detail that was hidden off camera in the Rain World render. Lots and lots of feathers Here
        along with robotic legs for the bird.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Screenshot3.png" alt="Back of slug toaster">
    <p>
        This is the back of the slug toaster. I put it in material view so you can read the text on the buttons easier. This toaster is actually based on the toaster
        in my house and features a bagel, defrost and reheat function along with a knob to control heat and the lever for lowering the toast into the toaster. You can 
        see that the toaster is currently in bagel mode.
