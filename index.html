<section class="Introduction">
    <p>My name is Jed, and I have a great passion for art and media. I love to delve into the world of multimedia and makerspaces. Some of the different projects I have
        worked on include: 3D modelling, music, digital art, computer programming and more. I especially
        love music the most, as it is the first art form I really got into through learning guitar. Since then my interests have branched out and I taught myself
        a bunch of new skills, like learning how to use Blender to make 3D scenes and animations. Here on my website you can see some of the projects I have worked on
        and learn a little bit about who I am and my interests. To the top left of the screen is a dropdown menu which you can use to navigate my site and
        learn more about what I do. Below the navigation are my other social platforms.
