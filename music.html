        Welcome to the music page! Here you can take a look at some of my musical projects. I make songs using FL Studio and Garageband
        and I play the guitar.

<section class="Introduction">
    <h1 class="important-header">Music Making</h1>
    <p>
        I love music! Since I was young I always enjoyed listening to and creating songs. I learned how to play the guitar and I joined
        my school's band program whenever I had the option to. I began making my own songs after I was inspired by the videogame
        "My Singing Monsters". When I first played the game, I loved how each monster had its own unique sound, so I began creating my
        own monsters with their own sounds using Garageband for IOS. Over time my interest in music production continued, so I eventually
        bought FL Studio to enhance my music making even further. I learned how to make music mostly through experimentation and finding
        my own style with the occasional Youtube tutorial when I want to dive into a new genre.
    </p>
    <h1>Synthesized Jungle</h1>
    <p>
        This first song I have to show is one I call "Synthesized Jungle". I originally made this song in Garageband for the purpose of
        being a song that would play in the background of a glowing, synthwavy city. I loved the song I created, and once I got FL Studio
        I recreated the song with the more powerful software and improved upon the original. Later on I ended up creating a 3D render of
        the city I imagined which I call "Synsun City", a place that's full of glowing neon lights and is heavily inspired by the look of the synthwave genre.
        Once the render was finished I used it as the background of a video I created which showcases my song. Below is that video which is 
        found on my Youtube channel.

    <p>
        The song is heavily inspired by the synthwave genre, a style of music which features lots of synth sounds from the 1980s, analog
        instruments, chill atmospheres and accompanying visuals that often feature old VHS aesthetics and cool colours. Once I discovered
        the style I instantly fell in love with it. This song was my first attempt at creating something that sounded like synthwave.
    </p>
    <h1>Bloody Waters</h1>
    <p>
        This next piece is a slow, more calm and relaxing song. Imagine this. It's a beautiful evening, with the great glowing sun slowly dipping below the horizon.
        The cool gentle air breezes the top of your head as you stand on a beach of grey and blue sand. The water has a deep red colour, that of blood and rocky mountainous
        island dot the seascape. This is what I pictured in my head as I created this song. Like Synthesized Jungle, this song was meant to be in the background of a place,
        that place being the Red Sea (which is not the actual Red Sea). The Red Sea is an area of ocean, where so many bodies of the fallen were tossed that they turned
        the water red with their blood. Now the waters are filled with the vengeful ghosts of drowned sailors and pirates, looking for revenge on the living. I also originally
        made this song in Garageband but then recreated it in FL Studio to improve upon the original.

    <p>
        One of the big inspirations for this song is the videogame "Terraria". In that game there is a mod called the Calamity Mod which adds and area known as the
        Sulphurous Sea. The music there is calm and chill, which influenced me when I wanted to make my own song sound chill. I also made sure to include chords that
        give off a melancholy feeling to represent the tragedy of the Red Sea and how a once normal ocean turned red with blood.
    </p>
    <h1>Frutiger Aeroport</h1>
    <p>
        Next is a song which is a reflection of my memories at the airport. When I was younger I used to travel a lot by air, so I have many memories and experiences at
        airports. Then, I noticed a resurgence in the popularity of a visual aesthetic known as frutiger aero. Frutiger Aero was quite popular in the 2000s and early 2010s,
        and features skeuomorphism, glossy textures and images of a bright future. The old Apple app icons and the Nintendo Wii's look are examples of this style. This song is meant to embody the feeling that frutiger aero gives off, with a soothing
        atmosphere and upbeat optimism. Now imagine, if you will, it's the early 2010s. You're sitting in one of the many seats throughout the airport near your gate,
        waiting for the announcement that boarding will begin soon. Suddenly, the announcements come on and your flight is delayed by an hour. To pass the time you put 
        on your headphones, plug them into your phone and begin listening to the relaxing song of the Frutiger Aeroport. Time flies as you zone out, then you wake up and it's 
        boarding time.

        A friend of mine, known online as Tora I4-Icey created the beautiful drawing below to go along with the song. It depicts my mascot slug dude doing what I described above.

    <h1>My Singing Monsters</h1>
    <p>
        My Singing Monsters is a super important game to me. It's what got me into making music in the first place which is something I love! Below is a cover I made of
        the most recent new song added to the game as I write this, "Magical Nexus". Similar to my song Synthesized Jungle, I created a synthwave style song with many spacey
        effects and analog sounds. This time however I created an animation in Blender to go along with, with the help of many Youtube tutorials of course. Once the 3D
        segment and the cover of the original song were both finished, I put them into my editing software Davinci Resolve and added some final touches and effects to 
        make the video nice and pretty.

    <p>
        I've created many other My Singing Monsters covers and remixes in the past. This is just one of the covers I wanted show here on my site. The way I got about
        creating covers of songs from My Singing Monsters is pretty simple. I listen to the sounds that each monster makes, then recreate those sounds and modify them
        in my music software. Later on I add any extras details and effects I need until everything comes together in one monstrous show.

    <h1>Rain World Mods</h1>
    <p>
        A while ago me and some others began work on a mod for the videogame "Rain World" from Videocult. We began work on two mods, the first being a new region of the game
        called Weathered Capital. For the second mod it is a combination of Rain World and the game "Katana Zero" by Askiisoft. Both are still in progress at the time of writing this. I made the music for both of these mods, as well as the sound effects for ScugZero.
        First up below is a song for the Weathered Capital mod which I call "Ruined City". The song is meant to sound somewhat mysterious and convey the feeling of a once
        great place falling into ruin. I added lots of atmosphere and ambience to this song using reverb and gave the song a slow tempo to create a melancholy energy.
    </p>
    <audio src="sou/Ruined City.mp3" controls atl="Ruined City"></audio>
    <p>
        The next song is one for the ScugZero mod which I call "The Sailor". By the way, if you want to see more about the ScugZero mod and its development you can find more info <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/detroitteam">here</a>. This is a remix of an already existing song in Rain World called "The Captain". I tried incorporating
        synthwave elements and added many extra sounds to create a feeling of intensity and urgency. In this mod the player will be journeying through Rain World on a
        quest to kill everything, so I tried creating music to match that.

    <p>
        The different projects you see on this page are just some of my many musical projects. I love music so much and hold it close to my heart. Creating it is an absolute joy and I love hearing
        what others have made too. I am continuing to try and improve my musical talent by practicing guitar when I can and creating beats with FL Studio.
        Stay tuned for future updates and have a good day!
