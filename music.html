        Welcome to the 3D Stuff page! Here you can take a look at some of my 3D-related projects. I make 3D models and animations using Blender and I have
        created 3D prints as well.

        The software I use to make my 3D projects is Blender which is a free and open-source software. I learned how to use Blender through tutorials on Youtube
        and messing around with Blender on my own time.

    <h1>Synsun City</h1>

        Here is a 3D render of mine which I created in school. For this one I played around with the lighting and the colours until it was right.
        This piece is inspired by the music style of Synthwave which is often complemented by cool visuals of neon cityscapes and beautiful lights. I tried
        replicating that style by using lots of blues and purples and including many glowing lights emanating from the buildings. I also threw in some cars to 
        liven up the place and the Synthwave sun in the background to watch over the cityscape.
