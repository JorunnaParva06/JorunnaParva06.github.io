        Welcome to the computer programming page! Here you can take a look at some of my coding projects. I have some experience with python code and a little bit of pygame too.

<section class="Introduction">
    <h1 class="important-header">Coding with Python</h1>
    <p>
        A few years ago I wanted to learn how to code, since I used to play a lot of videogames and felt inspired to make my own. I never really ended up making any games
        (except for one which you'll see later) and mostly learned how to code through the makerspace class at my school and online courses offered by the Schulich Ignite program of the University of
        Calgary. I'm not exactly a super pro or anything, but I've worked on a few computer programming-related projects which I showcase here.

    <h1>12 Thousand Pixels Up</h1>
    <p>
        The first project I have to show here is one which I made with the Schulich Ignite program offered by University of Calgary. For those who don't know, every so often
        University of Calgary offers a free coding course for python. I enrolled in thede courses two times, and the second time I enrolled we learned about object oriented
        programming. By the end of the class we all had created games using pygame. The game I made is called "12 Thousand Pixels Up". In this game you must jump on floating 
        platforms to reach the top while you avoid obstacles along the way and outrun the rising lava. If you would like to play the game you can download it through the GitHub linked below and then
        run the file called "12 Thousand Pixels Up.py" to play. If you don't want to download it that's fine; I also have a video which you can watch.

        Creating this was not easy. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get jumping to properly work, since I had to create my own physics rather than be
        able to rely on a game engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine to calculate the physics for me. This was also my first time creating a game using python, so a lot
        of the stuff I did to make this game was completely new to me. From creating this game I learned more about how code can be used to influence differnent elements
        and more about taking parts of different python files and putting them together.
   </p>
   <h1>Unity</h1>
   <p>
        Before, I really badly wanted to make games. Videogames are important to me, as I've been playing them my whole life, although not as much as of late. Since I 
        wanted to make my own game I began watching tutorials on how to use Unity to make games. Unity is a powerful game engine that makes game development much more
        optimized. I've never finished a game using Unity (for now), but below are some projects which I worked on.
