        Welcome to the computer photography! Here you can take a look at some of my photography projects. I mostly take photos using my phone, but I've also had some experience
        using digital and film cameras.

    <p>
        For quite a while now I've been taking photos of anything I found that was interesting. I quite enjoying exploring and taking photographs of whatever I come
        across. I mostly take photos when I am travelling, and I have a lot of photos form my travels. In fact I awlays take so many photos that my phone ends up with
        no storage space left. Below are some of my favourite photos taken on my phone.

    <h1 class="important-header">Film Photography</h1>
    <p>
        Recently I joined a photography program called Through the Lens which was offered at my school. There we learned how to take photos with film cameras, develop film 
        and print out photographs in a dark room. I often wonder how people figured this stuff out, because developing and printing film feels like magic. Overall I had 
        a lot of fun in the Through the Lens program and I got to develop my very own film. Below are some photos I took with an Asahi Pentax KX camera.

        In addition to my photographs, I also created a short, spooky video which features some more photographs not shown above. The video below details the disturbing
        disappearance of Lucas Baker. I tried to make it look like found footage stored on an old VHS tape by adding some vintage effects to the video along with some
        background noise.

    <p>
        I edited this video using Davinci Resolve. It's a pretty nice editing software, the only problem is that it sets my computer on fire whenever I boot it up. The 
        editing itself also came with some challenges, like finding the right pacing, sound effects and overlays to use in my video to make it look old and creepy.

        The photos shown on this page are a fraction of the huge number of photos I have taken throughout the years. Photography is an awesome way for me to show the 
        travels I have been on and create beautiful memories by freezing time in a photograph. I will continue to take many photos wherever I go, and sometimes I'll find
        a gem in my endless catalog of photos to share with the world.
